					<h1>Who we Are.</h1>
					<ol class="pages">
						<li>
						
							<p>De Fuca Media is a premier creative firm working out of Southwest British Columbia, Canada. (Vancouver and Victoria, if you're really wondering.) We come to the table with one goal in mind: Delivering top-shelf design and strategy. If you're looking to one-up the competition, you've found the right place.</p>
							<h2>A Basic Philosophy</h2>
							<p>De Fuca Media believes in helping you succeed. After all, our success is best measured by yours. Our job is not only to design, but to present; How do we take an idea, give it wings, and make it fly? 
</p>
							<p>Every design firm can offer amazing aesthetics, but can they offer strategies for the future? De Fuca Media's pays impeccable attention to detail. Your project will be unique, defined, and future-proof. We try our very best to make every project a one-time investment of time and resources.
</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>We also insist that such a thing as a job too small or large simply doesn't exist. (Ambitious? Perhaps, but that's how we are.) Whether it be a new product without a name; a small local business looking to improve their presence, on- or offline; or a large corporation seeking a complete rebranding; we're here to help. If you've got a question, we've got the answer.</p>
							<h2>Let's Chat</h2>
							<p>Rather than presenting an exhaustive list of what we can offer, we kindly ask you to please visit our <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>, then <a href="contactus.html">drop us a line</a> and let us know what you need — we promise to offer you the best of our abilities, even if you are wondering whether what your dog just consumed is poisonous or not*</p>
